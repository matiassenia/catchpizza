# Gimme Gimme Pizzas

## Game Description

**Gimme Gimme Pizzas** is a simple and fun arcade game developed with Pygame. In this game, the player controls a basket (which represents the player) that moves left and right to catch pizzas falling from the top of the screen. The goal is to catch as many pizzas as possible while avoiding dangerous objects (like trash bags) that also fall.

As the player catches more pizzas, the falling speed of the pizzas increases, making the game more challenging over time.

### Game Mechanics:
- **Movement**: The player can move the basket left and right using the arrow keys.
- **Collisions**: The game detects collisions between the basket and the pizzas or dangerous objects. If the basket catches a pizza, the player earns points; if it catches a dangerous object or misses a pizza, the player loses a life.
- **Increasing Difficulty**: The speed of the falling pizzas increases as the player catches more pizzas, making the game more challenging as time progresses.

## What is Pygame?

Pygame is a Python library that makes it easy to create video games. A library in programming is like a toolbox that programmers use to perform complex tasks more easily and quickly. Instead of building everything from scratch, Pygame provides the necessary tools to draw graphics on the screen, move characters, add sounds, and much more in an easy-to-use way.

## Game Presentation

"Hello everyone, today I’m going to show you a game I created called *Gimme Gimme Pizzas*. In this game, we control a basket—actually, it's me in this case—that moves left and right to catch pizzas falling from the sky. But there’s a challenge: dangerous objects (like trash bags) are also falling, and we must avoid catching them. Every time I catch a pizza, the speed increases, and the game becomes more difficult!

I created it using a tool called Pygame, which is a library in Python. Pygame allows us to create games with graphics and sounds without having to write all the code from scratch. It’s like having a Lego set with pieces that you can assemble to create your own game world.

Now, I’ll show you how the game works and explain some of the features that make it fun and challenging. Let’s see how many pizzas you can catch before running out of lives!"
